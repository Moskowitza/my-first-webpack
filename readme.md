# WebPack setup

![WebPack](images/icon-square-big-150x150.png)

"At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles." -[WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/)

## This boiler plate includes

- webpack.config.js
  - module rules
  - resolvers for `js`, `jsx`
- .babelrc
  - `preset-env` for modern javascript
  - `preset-react` for jsx
